**DESCRIPTION: Python Basics**

Here begins my introduction to Python through the Alx backend engineering program. All commits to this repository are solely for building a solid Python foundation. 
I will study and practice exercises under the following Python concepts:

1. Basic operators in Python and datatypes
2. Algorithms, control flow, and looping constructs
3. Python library, modules, and data structures
4. Programming paradigms
5. Object-oriented programming (OOP).

**Week 1: Python Basics:**
This week, I learned about Python syntax, understood its focus on readability, and learned the importance of proper indentation. 
I understood the characteristics of Python as a high-level programming language, and the various use cases and applications of Python. Then I began writing simple Python programs.

Unique lesson: 
While trying the  Simple Interest Calculator task I learned how to use f-string to format a string easily - I used it to add the dollar sign to the calculated sum of annual savings.

**Week 2: Control Flow:**
This week, I explored building dynamic Python programs, utilizing If, Else, and Elif conditions, match case statements, and For and While loop constructs,
I gained an understanding of applying logic to Python programs.

Unique lesson:
The pattern_drawing task provided insights into immutable and mutable variables, also I learned the practical application of the end parameter in the formatting of output.

**Week 3: Function and Data Structures:**
This week was an introduction to functions and modules, I learned how functions help organize code, improve readability, and promote re-usability. Also, I learned about common -
data structures like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. And I understood when and how to use each one effectively.

Unique lesson:
The shopping_list_manager task was a unique learning experience, I familiarized myself with Python's datetime module, and utilizing its methods I practiced working on real-time - 
data for the first time.

**Week 4: Programming paradigms:**
This week was an introduction to Error and Exception handling, Testing in Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, and their implementation in Python.
I learned the core principles of OOP: classes, objects, encapsulation, and abstraction. I defined classes, created objects, and grasped the use of class attributes, instance methods, -
and the self keyword.

Unique lesson:
The library_management_system was a unique learning opportunity. In this task, I deeply understood the practical application of concepts such as return statements, looping through a list,
composition vs inheritance, object instantiation, and method invocation.

**Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming:**
This week's key focus was on advanced OOP core concepts like constructors, destructors, and magic methods. I also explored concepts like polymorphism,
method resolution order (MRO), and a deep dive into inheritance, and composition.

Unique lesson:
The library_system task grounded my understanding of __str__ and __repr__ dunder methods. I applied __str__ to print a formatted string for each class and used __repr__ for debugging.
